# Automating the Minutiae with Serverless and Gitlab CI  
This content contains code shared in my 2020 All Things Open talk, [Automating the Minutiae with Serverless and Gitlab CI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jm8PE8nfhPJe-c3mhBot5ycrUlGNaNPN/view?usp=sharing)

### /release-bot 
Serverless slack bot used for sending a daily slack announcement. Uses API calls to the Jira and Testrail APIs.

### /scripts
GitlabCI pipeline automation scripts and pipeline configuration file (.gitlab-releaseops.yml)

*Note*: Due to this code being the product of a work assignment, it has been completely removed from the context in which it normally runs. The scripts are meant to be used as a source of reference, therefore, and not as a single, runnable app. That said, feel free to use the code as a framework for beginning to automate your own processes. And thanks for coming to my talk!
